# Before you donate...

There are a few things I want you to know before you make a donation, involving terms and whether you should donate 
to begin with.

**PLEASE read everything if you have time, or at least the summary at the bottom. Otherwise, please refrain from** 
**donating.**

Know in advance that donations are made through Ko-fi/PayPal, in case you don't use those platforms.

## My projects

**Most of my projects are considerably derivative, based on the works of other people**. Perhaps the things you enjoy 
in my projects were made by said other people and you should donate to them instead of donating to me, or donate to 
no one at all if they don't accept donations.

Here are specific examples with my main projects. Feel free to read only the ones relevant to you:

### Nugget Doom

Nugget Doom is, first and foremost, a fork of [Woof!](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof). Woof! is a project in 
active development, being constantly improved, and I consistently merge those improvements back into Nugget; even 
though Nugget was forked from Woof! years ago, Nugget continues to benefit from the almost-daily improvements made to 
Woof!.

Besides that, many of the features I added to Nugget were taken conceptually from other ports or media (that is, I 
got the ideas from elsewhere) and implemented with my own code, but in some cases I did outright take code from other 
ports. All of this is acknowledged in [Nugget's feature list](https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom#features).

Lastly, [some people](https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom#acknowledgements) have contributed to Nugget directly, 
by explaining things to me, providing assets, or coding and implementing features, not to mention the various 
[feature requests, suggestions, and bug reports](https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom/issues) made by users.

### Smooth Doom MBF21

Smooth Doom MBF21 is obviously based on 
[Smooth Doom](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/69451-smooth-doom-update-41420/), using most of its assets and a 
fair bit of its code (DECORATE and DECOHack have nearly identical syntax).

### Music

Most of the music I make is MIDI covers of songs made by other people, need I say more?

---

To be fair with myself, though, although I may not have all the ideas, realizing them can take a lot of time and 
grunt work. Also, many things are derivative these days, and my case might not be anything special, but I really 
just want to be crystal-clear about it.

## Terms

In short: **donations are completely voluntary, no rewards are offered in return.**

I work on my projects for fun, and I'm free to take breaks from them or abandon them completely. I want to keep 
things that away.

Because of that, **donations do not guarantee that I'll continue working on any of my projects**. This is why 
donations are for my works in general, not tied to any specific project.

Also, all of my current projects are free for everyone; everyone has and should continue to have full access to them. 
So, **you won't be given any rewards (early access, exclusive content, etc.) for your donations, and your requests** 
**(if any) won't necessarily be given higher priority**. In fact, if you want to donate just so that I "notice" you 
(which I don't expect), please don't; who am I for you to care about anyways?

Ultimately, these donations are only meant to be a way of thanking me for the things I've done, for those who feel 
generous enough to drop a few bucks. As much as I insist on keeping my projects free, and as much as I seem to have 
issues gaging the value of my effort, it would undeniably be awesome to make some money out of what I enjoy doing. 

All of this said, don't get me wrong: if you do donate, I _will_ be very grateful to you. You'd be donating purely 
out of your own volition, after all.

## Summary and donation link

Again, **if you haven't read everything above, please read the following summary, or refrain from donating** 
**otherwise.**

- **Donations are voluntary, they do not guarantee continued development of my projects, and no rewards are offered** 
  **in return.**
- **Most of my projects are based on other existing projects by other people whom perhaps you should donate to** 
  **instead:**
  - Nugget Doom is based on Woof! and has a few direct contributors besides me.
  - Smooth Doom MBF21 was clearly made off of Smooth Doom.
